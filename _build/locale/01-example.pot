msgid "This method is static. See the ``.rst`` source file for how this is defined. Also notice that this method appears in the TOC, there is no section heading in the actual body of the document. This is because of a custom ``hidden`` role which hides the heading in the body, but lets Sphinx render it in the TOC. If you just put a heading there without the \"hidden\" part, you'd get the same result, except that the heading would show in the content as well, thus duplicating the function name."
